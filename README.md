## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header with a button to the profile page and a hamburger dropdown nav| 
| Login Page | Allow the user to Login to their account |
| Rgister Page | Allow the user to create a new account |
| Post Div | This will render a post|
| Create Post Form | This will render a form for a user to create a post |
| Homepage Page | This will render all of the most recent posts |
| Search Nav | This will render two buttons, one to search posts by topic and tag and one to search by the author of the posts |
| Profile Page (My posts) | This will render all of the users most recent posts |
| Profile Page (Liked posts) | This will render all of the users liked posts |
| Profile Page (Account) | This will render all of the users Account info |


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

## Code Snippet

this handleChange function for the registration feature was my first attempt at setting up a password confirmation system. while I feel I could address the conditional logic a bit better I was reasonably pleased with how intuitve it was to get this function up and running.

```
const handleChange = (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.name);
    if (event.target.name === "submited_password") {
      console.log("hi");
      submited_password = event.target.value;
      console.log(submited_password);
    }
    if (event.target.name === "confirm_password") {
      confirm_password = event.target.value;
      console.log(confirm_password);
    }
    if (submited_password === confirm_password) {
      setFormData({ ...formData, password: [submited_password] });
    }
    if (
      event.target.name !== "submited_password" &&
      event.target.name !== "confirm_password"
    ) {
      console.log("name");
      setFormData({
        ...formData,
        [event.target.name]: [event.target.value],
      });
    }
    
  };

```

## Issues and Resolutions

- Issue: I had trouble getting my transitions to animate with styled componenets.
    - Resolution: After some investigation I discovered that styled components uses keyframes to animate.
- Issue: While referenceing user info state the sate would be reset on any refresh the information would be lost and those references would error out
    - Resolution: I stored the required information from user in session storage so that rerenders can occur without dumping all the realevant information.
- Issue: While developing the backend I had a broken migration that was breaking the database when it was deployed.
    - Resolution: commenting out the changes in the offending migrations allowed th heroku app to build properly.
